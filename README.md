# Library Project

## Overview

This project is a **Book Library** application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their book collection by adding, displaying, updating, and removing books. The main focus of this project was to practice and learn **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add books by entering the title, author, number of pages, and read status.
- **Display Books**: Books are displayed dynamically on the main grid with details like title, author, and pages.
- **Read Status Toggle**: Users can mark books as "Read" or "Not Read" and update the status easily.
- **Remove Books**: Provides a remove button for each book to delete it from the collection.
- **Modal Form for Book Entry**: A modal form is used to input book details, enhancing the user experience.
- **Local Storage Support**: The application saves the book collection to local storage, so the data persists even after the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles DOM manipulation, form validation, and local storage.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling
├── script.js           # JavaScript file for DOM manipulation and logic
├── images/             # Folder for icons and images
```

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript. Key takeaways include:

- Creating and updating HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- Handling user interactions through event listeners (e.g., form submission, button clicks).
- Implementing **modal functionality** for better user input experience.
- Using **local storage** to save and retrieve data, making the application state persistent across sessions.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-project.git
   cd library-project
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the library application.

## Future Improvements

- Add form validation for better input handling (e.g., prevent duplicate entries).
- Implement search and filter features to easily find specific books.
- Enhance the UI design with animations and improved styling.
- Add user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own book collections.
